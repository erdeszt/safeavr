# SafeAVR

(Somewhat)MISRA2012 compliant C library for AVR microcontrollers.

The library is composed of two parts: `core` and `hal`.

The `core` part is a replacement for [avr-libc](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/) it provides bindings for the registers of the AVR MCU in a more structured way(structs & enums instead of macros to register addresses and bit values). It also helps with unit testing by avoiding the header only approach of `avr-libc` and instead splitting the interface from the actual bindings which can be replaced at link time.

The `hal` part is an abstraction layer built on top of `core` that hides some of the details of the underlying hardware and makes it easier to write portable code.

It also comes with a reusable AVR `CMake` helper (`Avr.cmake`), based on [https://github.com/mkleemann/cmake-avr](https://github.com/mkleemann/cmake-avr) and an [https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/) config.
